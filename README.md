# Alice's Customs Items Mods

Server-side mod aims at creating customize option for items in Minecraft's Multiplayer Server.

Main Purpose is to:
- Allow renaming items with color code or format.
- Allow writing lore and description for items.
- Allow adding or editing custom level of enchantment to items.
- Allow modifying potion effect of potions.

Complementary Stuff that I want to add:
- Allow binding command to items, like PowerTools.
